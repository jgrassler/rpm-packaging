Ceilometer aims to deliver a unique point of contact for billing systems to
aquire all counters they need to establish customer billing, accross all
current and future OpenStack components. The delivery of counters must be
tracable and auditable, the counters must be easily extensible to support new
projects, and agents doing data collections should be independent of the
overall system.

Monasca Ceilometer (Ceilosca) is an add-on to Ceilometer
which enables the metering data to be stored in Monasca
Datastore via publisher mechanism as monasca metrics.
Monasca Ceilometer also provides monasca storage driver
which enables access to the monasca metrics via the
Ceilometer V2 API.
